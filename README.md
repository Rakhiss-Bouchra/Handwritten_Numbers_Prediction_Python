# Handwritten_Numbers_Prediction_Python
Handwriten Prediction with MNIST database involves building a machine learning model to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST database. The MNIST database contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of handwritten digits, each 28x28 pixels in size.

The goal of the project is to train a model on the training data and evaluate its performance on the test data by measuring its accuracy in predicting the correct digit for each image.
